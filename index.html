      <p>Legislation to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 18 years old has been slowly folded in over the past year. Last October 16-year-olds could not be tried as adults for non-violent offenses. As of the past month the same rule has been applied for 17-year-olds. </p>

      <p>In the Bronx, this has resulted in a shaper decline in arrests among minors in the last year as criminal justice policy in the Bronx aims to decrease incarceration among the group. Patrice O’Shaughnessy, communications director for Bronx district attorney Darcel Clark, says the decrease in arrests is partly because of the new legislation and partly because of longstanding efforts by the DA’s office.</p>

      <p>“For non-violent low level offenses, DA Clark has long been in favor of alternatives to incarceration for youths,” she said. </p>

      <p>While crime decreases across the city, the biggest change can be seen among minors in the past year as raise the age legislation slowly takes affect. </p>
